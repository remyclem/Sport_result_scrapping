Sport_result_scrapping
======================

This project is about collecting data about sport and bookmaker predictions from [oddsportal](http://www.oddsportal.com/), 
and formatting them into a _.csv_ for further use.

- scrap_with_gui.py opens a window from where to ask the request
- scraping.py is the core, it is the part that makes the http request and converts the results into a csv
- scraping.ipynb is merely for development and debugging purposes
